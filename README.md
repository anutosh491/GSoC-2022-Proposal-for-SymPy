Title: Improving Series Expansions and Limit Computations
Abstract:
Series expansions, in the field of symbolic computation, is an area of major study in mathematical analysis. The current implementation of series expansions in SymPy is developed to a large extent, but not yet complete . This proposal aims to tackle a good chunk of the remaining work through the following proposed ideas 
* Improve leading term & series method for functions involving branch cuts/ branch points 
* Adding leading term and series support to elementary/special functions 
* Fixing limit errors through gruntz algorithm and improving the algorithm overall 
* Refactoring written code for order term 
* Addressing miscellaneous bugs and implementation ideas related to the series module
