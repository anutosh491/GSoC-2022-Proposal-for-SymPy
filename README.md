Abstract - 
Series expansions, in the field of symbolic computation, is an area of major study in mathematical analysis. The current implementation of series expansions in SymPy is developed to a large extent, but not yet complete . This proposal aims to tackle a good chunk of the remaining work through the following proposed ideas 
1) Improve leading term & series method for functions involving branch cuts/ branch points 
2) Adding leading term and series support to elementary/special functions 
3) Fixing limit errors through gruntz algorithm and improving the algorithm overall 
4) Refactoring written code for order term 
5) Addressing miscellaneous bugs and implementation ideas related to the series module
